# About the game
I have chosen to create an application based on basketball. 'The Ultimate Basketball Trivia' aims, on one hand, through the 'Quiz' section, to test the player's general knowledge about this sport. On the other hand, the 'Difference Game' aspect aims to identify the level of attention the player gives when identifying differences.
# Quiz
The questionnaire consists of 10 questions, with the player having 4 answer options, only one of which is correct. I decided to include these questions because the answers represent both basic information and interesting or general culture-related information regarding basketball. If the player answers correctly, the next question will be displayed. Otherwise, the player will be shown a MessageBox communicating the correct answer, and then the next question will be displayed. This questionnaire cannot be exited; it must be completed. At the end, the player is shown a MessageBox with the number of correct answers given and the percentage obtained.
# Difference Game
The other part of the application is represented by a game, where the player is required to identify 8 differences. If the player feels they can no longer identify any differences, they can exit the game at any time by clicking the VERIFICARE button, which will display a MessageBox.
# Structure
The application consists of 3 forms. One corresponds to the main page, while the other two correspond to the two parts of the application.
# Technical details
On the main page, there are 4 access buttons. The EXIT button is intended to exit the player from the application. The DIFFERENCE GAME button is meant to lead the player into the spot-the-difference game, while the QUIZ button displays the questionnaire to the player. The INSTRUCTIUNI button opens a MessageBox dedicated to informing the player about the two parts of the application.
# The usage mode of the application
For the composition and appearance of the questions, I used 10 cases, one dedicated to each question in the form. Taking as an example question number 1 from the first questionnaire, the image associated with the question is assigned to pictureBox1 and is taken from the application's resources. The image's name follows the format 'intrebareaX.jpg'. The text of the question is associated with lblQuestion, and the answers are assigned to each of the 4 buttons. RaspunsCorect serves the purpose of signaling which button contains the correct answer, allowing the correctness of the response to be identified. Each button, depending on its number, is assigned the Tag 1, 2, 3, and 4, thus recognizing the correct answer.
For the appearance of the differences, I used 8 cases, one dedicated to each difference in the form. Taking as an example difference number 7 from the second questionnaire, we have label1 which is responsible for counting the differences. When a difference is discovered, the player must click on it, and then the pictureBox corresponding to the segment of the image containing the difference will disappear.
